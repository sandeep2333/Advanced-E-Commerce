# Advanced E-Commerce Application with Augmented Reality Simulation

## Project Overview

This project is an advanced e-commerce application developed in Java, featuring a graphical user interface (GUI) built using Java Swing. The application simulates a shopping experience where users can search for products, virtually try them on, update their profiles, add reviews, and compare different items. It incorporates augmented reality concepts to enhance the user experience.

## Features

- **Search Products**: Users can search for products by name, category, or brand.
- **Filter Products**: Filter products based on categories such as Clothing, Footwear, and Accessories.
- **Virtual Try-On**: Users can virtually try on products and receive size recommendations based on their profile.
- **User Profile Management**: Update user profile with height, weight, and preferred size.
- **Add Product Reviews**: Users can add reviews to products and view existing reviews.
- **Compare Products**: Compare the details of two different products side by side.
- **Product Catalog**: Includes a variety of products such as T-Shirts, Jeans, Sneakers, Sunglasses, Belts, and more, each with brand information and available sizes.

## Technologies Used

- **Java**: Core programming language used for application logic.
- **Java Swing**: Used for creating the graphical user interface (GUI).
- **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)**: Implemented using classes and objects for modular and reusable code.
- **Collections Framework**: Utilized for managing product lists and reviews with `ArrayList`.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- **Java Development Kit (JDK)** 8 or higher.
- An Integrated Development Environment (IDE) like IntelliJ IDEA, Eclipse, or NetBeans.

### Running the Application

1. Clone the repository or download the source code.
2. Open the project in your preferred IDE.
3. Compile and run the `AdvancedECommerceARApp` class.
4. Interact with the GUI to search for products, try them on, update your profile, and more.

### Usage

- **Search Products**: Enter the product name or category and click "Search Products."
- **Filter Products**: Enter a category and click "Filter Products."
- **Try On Products**: Enter a product ID and click "Try On" to check size compatibility.
- **Update Profile**: Enter height, weight, and size, then click "Update Profile."
- **Add Review**: Enter a product ID, then provide a review when prompted.
- **Compare Products**: Enter two product IDs and click "Compare Products."

## Future Enhancements

- Integration with a database to store user data and product information persistently.
- Implementing augmented reality (AR) features for a more immersive virtual try-on experience.
- Expanding the product catalog with more categories and brands.
- Adding user authentication and personalized shopping experiences.
